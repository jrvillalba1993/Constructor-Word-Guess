<h2>Constructor-Word-Guess!</h2>
<h4>Julian Villalba</h4>
The goal of this HW was to create a word guess game using Node, Javascript, and Inquirer.
The rules are: You are assigned a random word. You have 10 tries to guess the world properly. You can only use lowercase letters that are A-Z.

This project is composed of 3 JS files: index.js, letter.js, and word.js
I used npm install to make sure I had inquirer and had the proper modules.
I went ahead and worked on index.js first

I came up with the 10 random words by googling "Random Word Generator" and generating 10 words at random.

I then proceeed to work on the other JS files.
The game can be started by opening up terminal in visual studio code for the index.js file.
Once the terminal is open type in "node index.js" and it starts!

We are then assigned our first word we have to guess!

I then proceeded to guess the letter A and got it right.

I then purposely guessed the wrong letter and it used up one of my 10 tries putting me at 9.

I then went ahead and guessed the rest of the word. As you can see once I guessed it, it told me I won and went ahead and assigned a new word for me to guess
